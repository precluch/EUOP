\indent A reading from the Acts of the Apostles:

Observing the boldness of Peter and John and perceiving them to be uneducated, ordinary men, the leaders, elders, and scribes were amazed, and they recognized them as the companions of Jesus. Then when they saw the man who had been cured standing there with them, they could say nothing in reply. 

So they ordered them to leave the Sanhedrin, and conferred with one another, saying, «What are we to do with these men? Everyone living in Jerusalem knows that a remarkable sign was done through them, and we cannot deny it. But so that it may not be spread any further among the people, let us give them a stern warning never again to speak to anyone in this name.» 

So they called them back and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. Peter and John, however, said to them in reply, «Whether it is right in the sight of God for us to obey you rather than God, you be the judges. It is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard.» 

After threatening them further, they released them, finding no way to punish them, on account of the people who were all praising God for what had happened.
