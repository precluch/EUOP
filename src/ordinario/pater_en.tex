\be Our Father, who art in heaven,\redast hallowed be thy name;\redast thy kingdom come,\redast thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\redast Give us this day our daily bread,\redast and forgive us our trespasses,\redast as we forgive those who trespass against us;\redast and lead us not into temptation,\redast but deliver us from evil.
