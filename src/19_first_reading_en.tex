\indent A reading from the Acts of the Apostles:

Peter and John were going up to the temple area for the three o’clock hour of prayer. And a man crippled from birth was carried and placed at the gate of the temple called «the Beautiful Gate» every day to beg for alms from the people who entered the temple. When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms.

But Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said: «Look at us.» He paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them. Peter said: «I have neither silver nor gold, but what I do have I give you: in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazorean, rise and walk.» Then Peter took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles grew strong. He leaped up, stood, and walked around, and went into the temple with them, walking and jumping and praising God.

When all the people saw him walking and praising God, they recognized him as the one who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with amazement and astonishment at what had happened to him.
